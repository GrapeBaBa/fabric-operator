This package is imported from Kubernetes 1.5 branch .

client-go doesn’t have leader election package imported at the time of writing.
We are trying our best to communicate with upstream and get that package imported to client-go.

Meanwhile, that process is slow, and even complicated due to a few aspects:

- The importing work seems to be happening on 2.0/master but not 1.5 that we are using.
- We are using client-go 1.5 which is k8s 1.4, and we need to pull packages from k8s 1.5 due to some concern.
  This is mixing versions, which gets things more complicated.
- This might introduce new API to client-go 1.5, which might get things more complicated.
- There are still concerns on upstream on “write to endpoints”. This is the most complicated.

The situation is complicated, and we need to expedite our work.
Thus, we fork "pkg/client/leaderelection" from Kubernetes 1.5 branch to our repo.

Nonetheless, we should try our best to push the changes to upstream and communicate with community members to resolve the problem.
After that we should replace it to client-go again.
